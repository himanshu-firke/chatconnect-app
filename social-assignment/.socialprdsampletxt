Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project: AI-Powered Social Media Scheduler
Hackathon: Humanity Founders – Internship Selection Challenge
🎯 Objective

Develop a full-stack AI-powered social media management platform that enables individuals and businesses to:

Connect their Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and Instagram accounts.

Generate personalized, human-like content using AI.

Schedule posts via a calendar interface with drag-and-drop support.

Automate cross-platform publishing through APIs.

Gain insights through analytics and AI-driven recommendations.

The goal is to create a platform that is user-friendly, reliable, and unique with AI features beyond basic automation.

🌟 Uniqueness (How We Stand Out)

Most participants will build a simple scheduler. Our project stands out with:

Tone Control AI Chatbot

Users can select tone → Professional, Friendly, Funny, Formal.

AI generates content adapted to tone.

Best Time to Post (AI-powered)

AI suggests optimal posting times based on industry.

Hashtag Generator

AI automatically suggests relevant hashtags for higher reach.

Analytics Dashboard

Visual reports (likes, comments, shares).

AI insights: “Posts at 6pm get 20% more engagement.”

Drag-and-Drop Calendar

Move posts visually to reschedule.

Team Collaboration (Optional)

Add multiple users to one account with roles.

📌 Features & Requirements
1. User Authentication & Social Account Linking

Email/password login (JWT).

Social media OAuth (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram).

Secure token storage in DB, auto-refresh on expiry.

2. AI Chatbot for Content Creation

Powered by Google Gemini API.

Context-aware to generate relevant posts.

Supports multiple tones and content types (text, image, video).

Auto-adaptation per platform.

3. Content Calendar & Scheduling

Interactive FullCalendar.js interface.

Drag-and-drop rescheduling.

Edit posts before publishing.

Smart AI-based scheduling suggestions.

4. Posting Automation

Automated scheduling and publishing using node-cron.

Posts saved in DB with datetime, platform, content, and tokens.

Background worker triggers post at scheduled time.

API calls:

Twitter/X: POST /2/tweets

LinkedIn: POST /ugcPosts

Instagram: Upload media → POST /me/media_publish

Handles API limits, retries, and logs errors.

5. Error Handling & Logging

Token refresh on expiry.

Retry failed posts with exponential backoff.

Dashboard notifications for errors.

Logs of published/failed posts.

6. Dashboard

Overview of connected accounts.

List of scheduled and published posts.

Engagement analytics.

Previews of how posts appear on each platform.
